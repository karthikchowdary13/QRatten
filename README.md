## 🌟 Overview

QRatten is a cloud-based QR attendance management platform designed for educational institutions.

It replaces outdated paper registers and unreliable attendance portals with a secure, real-time, offline-capable attendance system built for real classroom environments.

---

## 🎯 Why QRatten Exists

Traditional attendance systems suffer from major limitations:

* Teachers waste valuable class time calling roll
* Students exploit static QR codes through screenshots
* Legacy attendance portals are outdated and unreliable
* Most systems fail when internet connectivity drops

QRatten addresses these issues through a modern attendance architecture built for reliability, security, and usability.

---

## ⚡ Core Features

### 🔄 Dynamic Rotating QR Attendance

Teachers generate live QR codes for attendance sessions.
QR codes rotate every **30 seconds** to prevent sharing and misuse.

---

### 🛡 Anti-Proxy Protection

Each attendance token is:

* Single-use
* Time-limited
* Device validated
* Redis cache verified

---

### 📡 Offline-First Synchronization

Attendance scans made without internet are:

* Stored locally
* Queued automatically
* Synced when connectivity returns

---

### 👥 Multi-Role Platform

Dedicated dashboards for:

* **Students** – Attendance stats, shortage alerts, streak tracking
* **Teachers** – Live attendance feed, QR generation
* **Admins** – Reports, analytics, and user management
